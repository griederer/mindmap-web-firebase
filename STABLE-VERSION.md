## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Starting New Development:
1. **Always branch from release/v1.3**:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/v1.3
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Test locally before deploying**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Test in browser at http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. **Build and verify**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

4. **Deploy when ready**:
   ```bash
   npx firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Never:
- ❌ Don't checkout old commits (like 294820b) - they're incomplete
- ❌ Don't merge branches without testing
- ❌ Don't skip the build step before deploying
- ❌ Don't delete the release/v1.3 branch

git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 6379be2 feat: add custom node relationships system...

# 3. Clean build
rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite
npm install
npm run build

# 4. Deploy
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
