# Animation Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Camera animations were inconsistent:
- Node expansion: Sometimes smooth ✅
- Info panel display: Often abrupt ❌

## Root Cause
`previousValuesRef` was updated immediately when animation started, not when it completed. This caused rapid consecutive Auto Focus calls to be skipped because the system thought "nothing changed."

## The Fix

### 1. Update Previous Values After Animation Completes
**File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
**Line**: 202-205

```typescript
stage.to({
  // ... animation config
  onFinish: () => {
    previousValuesRef.current = { x, y, zoom }; // ✅ Now updates AFTER completion
  }
});
```

### 2. Validate Significant Change Before Animating
**File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
**Lines**: 175-191

Checks if position/zoom actually changed before starting animation.

### 3. Added Diagnostic Logging
Comprehensive console logs to trace execution flow:
- `[Auto Focus]` - Trigger detection
- `[ViewportStore]` - Store operations
- `[Animation]` - Animation execution

## Test It

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Expand nodes → Should see smooth 2-second animation
2. Show info panels → Should see smooth 2-second animation
3. Check browser console for detailed logs

## Expected Result
ALL Auto Focus actions now animate smoothly (2 seconds), while manual interactions (wheel zoom, drag) remain instant.

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/gonzaloriederer/nodem-clean/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
2. `/Users/gonzaloriederer/nodem-clean/src/stores/viewportStore.ts`

## Next Steps
1. Test thoroughly
2. Verify animations are smooth
3. Remove console.log statements (after testing confirms fix works)
