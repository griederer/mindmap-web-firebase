# Animation Fix - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 What Was Fixed
Inconsistent camera animations in Auto Focus system

## 🐛 The Bug
- **Symptom**: Some animations smooth, others abrupt/instant
- **Cause**: `previousValuesRef` updated too early (before animation finished)
- **Impact**: Rapid Auto Focus calls skipped animation thinking "no change"

## ✅ The Solution
Move `previousValuesRef` update to `onFinish` callback

```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Broken):
stage.to({ x, y, scaleX: zoom, scaleY: zoom, duration: 2.0 });
previousValuesRef.current = { x, y, zoom }; // Wrong timing!

// AFTER (✅ Fixed):
stage.to({
  x, y, scaleX: zoom, scaleY: zoom, duration: 2.0,
  onFinish: () => {
    previousValuesRef.current = { x, y, zoom }; // Correct timing!
  }
});
```

## 📍 Changed Files
1. `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` (lines 175-207)
2. `src/stores/viewportStore.ts` (added logging)

## 🧪 Quick Test
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5174
# Try expanding nodes → Should animate smoothly (2 sec)
# Try showing info panels → Should animate smoothly (2 sec)
# Check console for "[Animation]" logs
```

## 📊 Success Criteria
✅ Node expansion: Smooth 2-second animation
✅ Info panel: Smooth 2-second animation
✅ Console shows: "Animation completed" messages
✅ No "skipping animation" messages
✅ Manual zoom/drag: Still instant (no animation)

## 🔍 Console Log Patterns

### Expected (Good):
```
[Auto Focus] Node expansion detected: {...}
[Animation] Starting smooth animation from {...} to {...}
[Animation] Animation completed
```

### Problem (Should NOT happen):
```
[Animation] No significant change, skipping animation
```

## 🧹 Cleanup (After Testing)
Remove all `console.log()` statements:
- Search: `grep -n "console.log" src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Keep: The actual fixes (`onFinish` callback, validation)
- Remove: All logging statements

## ⏱️ Timing Architecture
```
User Action
  ↓ 200-250ms delay
Auto Focus triggers
  ↓ immediate
Viewport state updates
  ↓ <1ms
Animation useEffect fires
  ↓ 50ms debounce
Animation starts
  ↓ 2000ms smooth transition
Animation completes
  ↓ NOW!
previousValuesRef updates ✅
```

## 🎓 Key Lesson
**Refs that track animation state must be updated AFTER animations complete, not when they start.**

This prevents race conditions where new animations think they've already reached the target position.
