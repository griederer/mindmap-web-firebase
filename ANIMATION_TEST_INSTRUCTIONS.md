# Animation Test Instructions

## Purpose
Test the fix for inconsistent camera animations in the mind map application.

## Bug Description
Camera animations were working smoothly for SOME Auto Focus actions but were abrupt/instant for OTHERS.

## Root Cause Identified
1. **Missing `stage.stopAnimation()` call**: When a new Auto Focus was triggered while a previous animation was still running, Konva would not properly start the new animation
2. **Premature `previousValuesRef` update**: The ref was being updated immediately when the animation started, not when it completed, causing issues with rapid consecutive Auto Focus calls

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Stop Running Animations (Line 163)
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Stop any running animation before starting new one
stage.stopAnimation();
```

### Fix 2: Update Previous Values After Animation Completes (Lines 186-189)
```typescript
onFinish: () => {
  console.log('[Animation] Animation completed');
  previousValuesRef.current = { x, y, zoom };
}
```

### Fix 3: Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive console logs to trace execution:
- `[Auto Focus]` - Triggers from node expansion and info panel
- `[ViewportStore]` - Store function calls and calculated targets
- `[Animation]` - Animation system state changes

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Node Expansion (Should be smooth)
1. Open the app with Auto Focus enabled (blue focus icon in bottom-right)
2. Click to expand a node with children
3. **Expected**: Camera smoothly animates (2 seconds) to show parent + all children
4. **Check console**: Should see:
   ```
   [Auto Focus] Node expansion detected: {...}
   [Auto Focus] Calling focusOnNodes after 200ms delay
   [ViewportStore] focusOnNodes called: {...}
   [Animation] type: AUTO_FOCUS
   [Animation] Starting smooth animation from {...} to {...}
   [Animation] Animation completed
   ```

### Scenario B: Info Panel Display (Previously abrupt, should now be smooth)
1. With Auto Focus enabled
2. Select a node (click it)
3. Click "Show Info" button (i icon) in the action menu above the node
4. **Expected**: Camera smoothly animates (2 seconds) to show node + info panel
5. **Check console**: Should see:
   ```
   [Auto Focus] Info panel detected: {...}
   [Auto Focus] Calling focusOnNodeWithPanel after 250ms delay
   [ViewportStore] focusOnNodeWithPanel called: {...}
   [Animation] type: AUTO_FOCUS
   [Animation] Starting smooth animation from {...} to {...}
   [Animation] Animation completed
   ```

### Scenario C: Rapid Consecutive Auto Focus
1. Quickly expand multiple nodes in succession
2. **Expected**: Each animation should start smoothly, stopping the previous one
3. **Check**: No abrupt jumps, no "stuck" animations

### Scenario D: Manual Interactions (Should remain instant)
1. Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
2. Drag the canvas to pan
3. **Expected**: Instant, responsive updates (no animation)
4. **Check console**: Should see:
   ```
   [Animation] type: MANUAL
   [Animation] Applying instant update
   ```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Node expansion: Smooth 2-second animation
- ✅ Info panel opening: Smooth 2-second animation
- ✅ Rapid consecutive Auto Focus: No abrupt jumps
- ✅ Manual interactions: Instant response
- ✅ Console logs show correct animation flow

## Console Log Prefixes
- `[Auto Focus]` - Auto Focus trigger detection
- `[ViewportStore]` - Viewport store operations
- `[Animation]` - Animation system execution

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/gonzaloriederer/nodem-clean/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
   - Added `stage.stopAnimation()` before new animations
   - Moved `previousValuesRef` update to `onFinish` callback
   - Added comprehensive logging

2. `/Users/gonzaloriederer/nodem-clean/src/stores/viewportStore.ts`
   - Added logging to `focusOnNodes()` and `focusOnNodeWithPanel()`

## How to Test
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Test each scenario above
4. Verify console logs match expected patterns
5. Confirm animations are smooth (2 seconds) for all Auto Focus actions

## Cleanup (Remove Logs After Testing)
Once testing confirms the fix works, remove console.log statements:
- Search for `console.log` in both modified files
- Remove all debug logging
- Keep the critical fixes (`stage.stopAnimation()` and `onFinish` callback)
